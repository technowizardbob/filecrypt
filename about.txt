I (Bob...) made some minnor tweaks to this program.
1) To allow for a key file.
2) To remove folder path info in TAR arachives (as it did not decode 100% of the time for me and was not how I wanted the folders to output anyways).

My changes made are noted in these files: archive_DIFF.patch.log, and filecrypt_DIFF.patch.log
